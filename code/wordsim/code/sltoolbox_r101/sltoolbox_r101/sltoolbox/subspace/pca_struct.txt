        - add a field: energyratio

In SLToolbox, a PCA model is represented by a struct with following 
fields:
- sampledim:    the dimension of original sample space
- feadim:       the dimension of feature space (the number of principal components)
- support:      the total weight of training samples supporting the PCA model
                (in non-weighted training, support is the number of training samples,
                 that is the weight of every sample is 1)
- vmean:        the mean vector
- P:            the projection matrix, for each sample, the feature can be
                obtained by y = P' * x
- eigvals:      the eigenvalues of all preserved dimensions
- residue:      the residue energy: the energy of the orthogonal complement
                to the principal subspace. (It is equal to the sum of all
                eigenvalues of discarded eigenvectors).
- energyratio:  the ratio of energy preserved in the principal subspace

Suppose a PCA model is based on d-dimensional sample space, and preserve
k principal components, then following conditions would be satisfied:
1. sampledim = d
2. feadim = k
3. vmean is a d x 1 vector
3. P is a d x k matrix
4. eigvals is a k x 1 vector
