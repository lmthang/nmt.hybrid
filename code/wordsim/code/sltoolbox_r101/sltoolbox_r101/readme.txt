Readme on sltoolbox

Created by Dahua Lin, on Sep 20, 2006

1. System Requirement
   (1) Windows system, (32bit or 64bit)
   (2) All functions are tested in Matlab 2006a (32bit) and Matlab 2006a x64. 
   (3) All mex files are are compiled and linked with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 in Matlab 2006a.
   (4) Most functions are usable in Matlab 7.0 and 7.04.
   
2. Install
	(1) Uncompress the zip file.The file packs two folders: sltoolbox (the codes) and sltdoc (the document) and several auxiliary files:
	- readme.txt  (This file)
	- introduction.txt (A file giving brief introduction of the features and contents of the toolbox)
	- tutorial.pdf (Presentation slides in pdf format to give a tutorial on the usage)
	(2) Start matlab and switch to the root folder of sltoolbox.
	(3) Type the commend "install_paths" to install the paths to matlab search paths.
	
3. Other issues
	(1) In normal cases, you can use all functions after you installed the paths without re-compiling the mex files.
	(2) If you would like to re-compile the C++ mex files, you can use install_cppcores.m in root directory of sltoolbox.
	(3) If you would like to re-compile the C++ mex in ann, you need the source codes of ANN Lib. 
	    It is available (free) in http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/
	(4) A function named slisomap requires the support of Matlab BGL. 
	    It is available (free) in http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/programs/matlab_bgl/

4. Documentation
  (1) It is the most convenient way to type help <function name> to obtain the detailed manual of the function
  (2) The introduction.txt gives a completed list of all functions.
  (3) A documentation generated by m2html is available in http://www.mydahua.net/sltdoc/index.html
